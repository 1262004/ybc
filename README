YBC - Yet another Blob Cache library.

This library provides support for in-process blob cache.

It has the following features:

* Persistence support. Cache data survives process restart if the cache
  is explicitly backed by files.
* Automatic recovery from corrupted backing files.
* Huge amounts of data can be cached. The maximum size of cached data
  is limited by free space on backing store. So thousands multi-GB media files
  can be easily placed into the cache if a backing store can handle such amount
  of data.
* Optimization for HDD and SSD devices.
* Atomic updates.
* Dogpile effect handling support.
* Automatic sharding of cache data among available backing store devices.
