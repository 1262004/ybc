YBC - Yet another Blob Cache library.

This library provides support for in-process blob cache with arbitrary size.

It has the following features:

* Huge amounts of data can be cached. The maximum size of cached data
  is limited by free space on backing store. So thousands multi-GB media files
  can be easily placed into the cache if a backing store can handle such amount
  of data.

* Atomic updates. It is safe updating an item when other threads are reading
  an old value for the item.

* 'Add transaction' support, which allows constructing item's value on the fly
  without serializing it into a temporary buffer.

* Multiple threads can simultanously add huge blobs into the cache.

* Dogpile effect (thundering herd) handling support.

* Support for sharding of cache data among available backing store devices.

* Instant invalidation of all items in the cache irregardless of cache size.

* Automatic recovery from corrupted backing files.

* Optimization for HDD and SSD devices.

* Multithreading support. The library is thread-safe out of the box.

* Persistence support. Cache data survives process restart if the cache
  is explicitly backed by files.
