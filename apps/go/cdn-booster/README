CDN booster

This is a dumb HTTP proxy, which caches files obtained from upstreamHost.

Currently go-cdn-booster has the following limitations:
  * Supports only GET requests.
  * Doesn't respect HTTP headers received from both the client and
    the upstream host.
  * Optimized for small static files aka images, js and css with sizes
    not exceeding few Mb each.
  * It caches all files without expiration time.
    Actually this is a feature :)
  * It caches only responses with 200 status codes.
  * It caches only responses with excplicitly set Content-Length.

Thanks to YBC it has the following features:
  * Should be extremely fast.
  * Cached items survive CDN booster restart if backed by cacheFilesPath.
  * Cache size isn't limited by RAM size.
  * Optimized for SSDs and HDDs.
  * Performance shouldn't depend on the number of cached items.
  * It has protection agains dogpile effect (aka "thundering herd").
  * It is deadly simple in configuration and maintenance. There is no need
    in running 'cleaners', 'watchdogs' or other similar tools. There is no
    need in setting up third-party libraries and/or tools. There is no
    need in writing complex configuration files. Just pass a couple of command
    line arguments to it and enjoy!

Thanks to Go it has the following features:
  * Scales automatically on multiple CPUs.
  * Handles large number of concurrent connections with minimum performance
    loss.
  * Supports keep-alive connections to upstream servers out-of-the-box.
  * Has clear, easy-to-read-and-hack code.

Use cases:
  * Substitution for Nginx, Varnish, etc. in front of large and/or slow
    file servers.
  * Poor-man's DIY geographically distributed CDN.
