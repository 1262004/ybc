CDN booster

This is a dumb HTTP proxy, which caches files obtained from upstreamHost.

Currently go-cdn-booster has the following limitations:
  * Supports only GET requests.
  * Doesn't respect HTTP headers received from both the client and
    the upstream host.
  * Optimized for small static files aka images, js and css with sizes
    not exceeding few Mb each.
  * It caches all files without expiration time.
    Actually this is a feature :)

Thanks to YBC it has the following features:
  * Should be extremely fast.
  * Cached items survive CDN booster restart if backed by cacheFilesPath.
  * Cache size isn't limited by RAM size.
  * Optimized for SSDs and HDDs.
  * Performance shouldn't depend on the number of cached items.
  * It is deadly simple in configuration and maintenance.
