Benchmark tool for go-cdn-booster or any other http/1.1 server.

This tool is similar to the well known 'ab' tool. The main difference
is that this tool issues HTTP/1.1 'Connection: Keep-Alive' requests
over the limited number of open connections. The number of such connections
is equivalent to workersCount.

Known limitations:
  * It cannot test HTTP servers without HTTP/1.1 keep-alive connections
    support.
  * Currently it shows only the following stats:
        * time taken for the test
        * Kbytes read - total Kbytes read from responses' bodies
        * qps - average queries per second
        * Kbps - average Kbytes per second received from the server.

How to build and run it?

$ sudo apt-get install golang
$ go get -u -a github.com/valyala/ybc/apps/go/cdn-booster-bench
$ go build -tags release github.com/valyala/ybc/apps/go/cdn-booster-bench
$ ./cdn-booster-bench -help

How to test nginx performance with go-cdn-booster-bench?

1. Set temporarily keepalive_requests in nginx config to 10000000
2. Run cdn-booster-bench -testUrl=http://nginx-host/path_to_test
3. Return back keepalive_requests to old value.

Currently go-cdn-booster outperforms nginx by ~2x on my laptop - 58Kqps vs
32Kqps with 12Kb file.
