Benchmark tool for go-cdn-booster or any other http/1.1 server.

This tool is similar to the well known 'ab' tool. The main difference
is that this tool issues HTTP/1.1 'Connection: Keep-Alive' requests
over the limited number of open connections. The number of such connections
is equivalent to workersCount.

Known limitations:
  * It cannot test HTTP servers without HTTP/1.1 keep-alive connections
    support.
  * It doesn't parse server responses and so doesn't gather stats regarding
    response status codes.
  * Currently it shows only the following stats:
        * time taken for the test
        * qps - average queries per second
        * Kbps - average Kbytes per second received from the server.
